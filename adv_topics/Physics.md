# Physics Advanced Topic Presentations

Before your presentation, use this file to get your talk outline approved. Be
sure to provide an estimated time to spend on teach topic (totalling 45 minutes)
and be sure not to repeat any topics covered in previous presentations.

## Presentation I
## Cats with Bats (slugout)

- Topic 1 Ball Properties and Dynamics (20 minutes):
  - different properties of the balls, including size, weight, elasticity, and density.
  - how they influence the behavior of the balls when they collide with each other and with other game objects.
  - ball spinning and its effect on gameplay (bat hits ball or ball hits object), including strategies for players to use spinning to their advantage.
- Topic 2 Collision Detection and Resolution (15 minutes)
  - Point of contact for circles
  - multiple objects colliding
  - Explain how you handle collision resolution, including bouncing off walls and surfaces, and how it affects gameplay.
  - optimizing collision detection for performance in a real-time game.
- Topic 3 Friction and Energy Absorption (10 minutes)
  -  friction in physics and how it affects the movement of balls on different surfaces.
  - Explain how we implement varying levels of friction and energy absorption for different materials and surfaces in the game
  - impact of friction on gameplay, such as how it affects ball speed and player movement.
