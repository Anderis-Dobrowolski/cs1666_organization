## Presentation I

Alexander Haurin,
Liying Qin
& Griffin Jordan

- Intro (10 minutes)
  
  - Explanation of goals we are aiming to achieve for our networking team:
    - Flawless multiplayer over a flawed system (expanding on what we mean by flawless e.g., synchronicity and scale)
    - how our approach will differ from other types of games (real-time FPS vs. a turn based card game)
  - Networked multiplayer in older games (90s to early 2000s)
    - Explain differnces of Peer-to-peer (P2P) vs Client-Server model
        - bandwidth limitations
        - why one is better than the other
    - LAN reducing latency, but comes with tradeoffs like connectivity over distance
    - Latency problems on networked connection: i.e handling of dropped connections and reconnecting
    - Explain how detecting and preventing cheating was much harder back then
    - Shining examples: DOOM, Unreal Tournament, Goldeneye and Mario Kart 64 (true pioneers)
  - Networked multiplayer in modern games (2010s to present)
    - Show how server architecture has greatly improved with things like dedicated servers and cloud-based solutions and saving
    - Real-time game data streaming (this will be important for our stretch goal of a stats & leaderboard system)
    - Show how scale and synchronicity has improved with time. Even complex ideas like cross-platform multiplayer that games can still struggle with today
    - Majority of games today come with the assumption of some level of multiplayer functionality
    - Shining examples: minecraft, GTA, Halo and of course **Counter-Strike**
  - Our approach to networking and how it differs/is similar to older and modern multiplayer networking solutions
  - Player host approach
  
- Server Implementation (15 minutes)
  - rust std::net
  - State Management
    - will be representing players cards, chips/$ amount, actual players and more
    - synchronization of these components across all clients is neccessary for proper game flow
    - things like the river cards should be represented on each players game. Can't have different river cards for different players
    - state management is incredibly important to keep the competitive integrity of poker alive
  - Lobby & Matchmaking system
    - Explaination of lobbys in poker game
    - player host creates a lobby or room which has a unique code
    - other players who wish to join can do so by entering a code generated by the host
    - Once everyone is in, game may begin
    - termination of game occurs when host chooses so. Specific triggers to allow for the start and stop of a game or lobby
    
- Client-Server Communication (10 minutes)
  - Player as host implementation
  - describe the cost and benefits of this approach
  - desirable experience for the host, other players may not have the same.
  - expand on this by showing the path data must go to be reached by players ... peer --> host --> peer
  - Serde
  - Protocol design
  - even though poker is turn based, we still must ensure each turn is the same for everyone
  - ex: game events such as the dealing of cards need to be represented on everyones screen
      - though some data needs to be hidden from users, most notably other players hands
  - player actions like betting, folding, checking, etc. and how we communicate that with other players
    - sure, its okay for other players to know something like a bet amount
  - game state updates
    - do we really need to transmit certain data to all players the time? No, some things are just not that important or act as unneccessary overhead and can stay localized 
      until needed. 
  - How we plan to handle latency, even though poker is not real-time

- Connection Management (10 minutes)
  - Accidental disconneciton is a very real problem
  - how we plan to handle such a case
  - reconnection and a saved game state
  - ambitious, but replacing disconnected player with bot
  - we don't just want the game to end and drop connection if one player in game gets disconnected
  - no one likes getting the "failure to connect to server" error, this can be better managed with our approach to implementing multiplayer
  - showcase how by having a player host and peer to peer type of networked multiplayer, we dont need to rely on outside servers to be running
